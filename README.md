# MuPe-Diversidades
MuPe-Diversidades is a diverse selection of samples of audios in Brazilian Portuguese, extracted from CORAA MuPe, and their respective transcriptions with prosodic segmentation annotation. It includes samples of speech of approximately 10 minutes for each state, around 5 minutes for each speaker from a singular state, who are diverse in gender and age.


**Version-0**

Includes anonymized audios and transcriptions with automatic prosodic segmentation annotation

Note: audios were cut every 30 seconds automatically at pre-processing steps and put back together, which was found to jeopardize the quality of prosodic segmentation annotation, so version 1.0 will soon be available with the correction of the problem


**Version 1.0**

Audios without cuts 

With manual review of the prosodic segmentation annotation
